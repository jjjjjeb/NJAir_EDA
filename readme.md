## Rutgers Bootcamp: Project 1 - Group 6

* We looked into Historical Air quality data in New Jersey over the last few decades.
* We used the Ambient Monitoring Archive of Hazardous Air Pollutants found at [EPA Toxics Data Archive](https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/toxdat.html#data)
* Findings were presented in a Prezi on 12-12-19, but our Exploratory Data Analysis can be viewed here: [Technical overview](https://github.com/jjjjjeb/Project-1_Group-6/blob/master/Historical_Air_Pollution_EDA.md)
